RealTimeRhyme (or Poetry Assistant as I refer to it on the [blog](https://blog.homeforfiction.com/2024/05/06/javascript-poetry-assistant)) is a program I put together for personal use (= it's sloppy, aesthetically Frnkenstein-like) to help with synonyms, rhymes, alliteration, stress, and definitions. Feel free to try it, but as I said, it's a bit sloppy.
